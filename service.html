                  <h3>Muskurahat Foundation (NGO)</h3>
                <p>In this foundation I worked as fund raising intern. Here, I collected funds from potential doner which help in education of unprevilege childrens.
                    During my time as a fundraising intern for underprivileged students, I experienced a profound sense of purpose and fulfillment. Working closely with the organization,<br>I delved into the heart of the cause, understanding the challenges faced by these students and the transformative power of education in their lives. Crafting compelling stories that showcased their resilience and achievements allowed me to connect with potential donors on a deeper level, sparking empathy and genuine interest in our mission.<br>
                   Embracing the digital era, I harnessed the power of social media to spread awareness far and wide. The overwhelming response from people across the globe was heartening, and I witnessed the true impact of collective action in shaping a brighter future for these deserving students.<br>Collaborating with other organizations and like-minded individuals further amplified our efforts, creating a united front to tackle this critical issue.Overall, this internship has been a transformative experience, showing me the profound impact of collective efforts in making education accessible to those who need it most.
